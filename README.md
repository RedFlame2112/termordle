Wordle Applet in terminal. Heavy inspiration from [Wordlet](https://github.com/scottluptowski/wordlet); if you want a higher quality applet, I suggest you check this out.


##How to run
Just download rust by running this in terminal
```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Afterwards, download the source as a .zip and unzip the files. I'd suggest you put the files into a new, decluttered folder you can easily access.

Head to that folder by running
```
$ cd [YOUR FOLDER NAME]
```
This folder would contain all the source files. After that, just run 
```
$ cargo build
```
and then
```
$ cargo run
```
in order to initialize the applet!
Hope you enjoy playing wordle ;)

also, I'd heavily suggest not looking at the `solutions.txt` text file while playing. That'd be cheating after all! (;

Have fun.
